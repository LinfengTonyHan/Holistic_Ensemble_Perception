Experiment 2: spatially distributed displays. 1~6 Mooney faces were displayed simultaneously. The overall distribution of the average emotional valence of all 300 trials follow a near-uniform distribution. ***MAIN_Spatial_Small.m***

Experiment 3: sequential displays. 1~6 Mooney faces were displayed simultaneously. The overall distribution of the average emotional valence of all 300 trials follow a near-uniform distribution. ***MAIN_Temporal.m***

Experiment 4: spatially distributed displays. 1~6 Mooney *upright or inverted* faces were displayed simultaneously. The overall distribution of the average emotional valence of all 600 trials follow a near-uniform distribution. ***MAIN_Combined.m***
