Experiment 5: rating the facelikeness of 500 Mooney face identities in *upright or inverted* viewing orientations. By subtracting the ratings between upright and inverted orientation, we could compute the "inversion effect score".

Experiment 6: rating the emotional valence of 250 selected Mooney face identities in *upright or inverted* viewing orientations.

Experiment 7a: sequential displays. 1~6 Mooney *upright or inverted* faces were displayed simultaneously. The overall distribution of the average emotional valence of all 600 trials follow a near-uniform distribution. ***Temporal_New_AC.m***.

Experiment 7b: spatially distributed displays. 1~6 Mooney *upright or inverted* faces were displayed simultaneously. The overall distribution of the average emotional valence of all 600 trials follow a near-uniform distribution. ***Spatial_New_AC.m***.
